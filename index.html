					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>My name is Nihaar Eppe, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. My academic focus lies in software engineering and data science, with a strong foundation in backend development, particularly in languages such as Java, C, and Python.
						In addition to my backend expertise, I am actively expanding my skill set to include frontend development. This website serves as a practical exercise in mastering HTML and CSS as well as incorporating AWS cloud EC2 instances to host servers, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with frontend technologies. Below, you will find a selection of both personal and academic projects that I have worked on, with the source code available via the provided GitHub link.

					<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
					<!-- your work experience -->
                    <h3>Where-To-Eat Restaurant App | Swift, Xcode, iOS, MapKit, CoreLocation</h3>
                    <ul>
						<li>Developed an iOS app using Swift and Xcode that helps users decide where to eat by allowing them to input and save their favorite restaurants.</li>
						<li> Integrated MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks to enable users to select a random restaurant near their current location based on customizable filters like cuisine type and price range.</li>
						<li>Implemented a clean, intuitive user interface with SwiftUI, showcasing ability to build polished UIs that provide a seamless user experience.
							</li>
						<li>Leveraged REST APIs to fetch up-to-date restaurant details and reviews, demonstrating proficiency in API integration and working with JSON data in Swift.
							</li>
					  </ul>
				  <h3>Machine Learning Fitness Tracker | Python, Pandas</h3>
				  <ul>
					<li>Developed a machine learning fitness tracker using Python to classify barbell exercises and count repetitions, leveraging accelerometer and gyroscope data from a MetaMotion sensor.</li>
					<li> Processed and cleaned raw sensor data by reading CSV files, splitting datasets, and handling outliers using techniques such as Chauvenetâ€™s criterion and local outlier factor.</li>
					<li>Engineered features and applied dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, followed by clustering algorithms to enhance data representation.
						</li>
					<li>Implemented and evaluated multiple predictive models, including Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, and neural networks, to accurately classify exercises and track repetitions.
					</li>
				  </ul>
				  <h3>Media Library Management System</h3>
				  <ul>
					<li>Designed and implemented a comprehensive Java program for efficiently managing and categorizing a diverse media
						library, including movies and music albums</li>
					<li> Incorporated advanced data structures to enable quick sorting, searching, and organization of media items based on
						various attributes such as genre, release date, and artist</li>
					<li>Developed a user-friendly interface allowing users to easily add, delete, and modify media items, enhancing the overall
						user experience and interaction with the library
						</li>
					<li>Implemented robust error handling and data validation to ensure reliability and accuracy of the media library data
						</li>
