					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>My name is Nihaar Eppe and I am currently a CS student at the Univeristy of Maryland.
						I plan to specialize in mainly software engineering or data science. The majority of my skills and languages lie in backend software devlopment such as Java, C, and python.
						Currently I am trying to learn more frontend skills which is why I am creating this website, to practice HTML and CSS. Below I have listed some personal and school related projects that I have worked on, 
						with project code being availabe through the github link.
